              <p class="project-details__desc-para">

                This Game was created on a part time contract for 
                <a href="https://www.studiose.design" 
                style="text-decoration:underline" 
                target="_blank">Studio SE</a>, 
                a Denver-based Company who offers instructional courses on 
                Model Based Systems Engineering and SysML 
                (a modeling and documentation language very similar to UML). 
                They were attending a trade conference and wanted a video game 
                to present in their booth as an attraction. They hired me as 
                the sole designer and programmer to create this video game 
                for them. While the final design was simpler than most of 
                my projects, this was largely due to a few particular 
                constraints. Most notably, the development cycle was only 
                a month long, with myself as the sole contractor and an 
                average maximum of 30 hours a week. 

              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                

                Despite these constraints, I was also given substantial 
                independence on the project, being responsible for the design
                and project management of the game.
                Drawing from the educational nature of my Clients’ Business
                model, I designed a game in which the player would utilize
                their knowledge of SysML syntax to answer prompted questions 
                and navigate the level. After laying out the original design,
                I then planned out a milestone schedule to ensure manageable
                expectations within the tight deadline. I planned single week 
                sprints for each major phase of development: initial 
                prototyping, a Minimum Viable Product, and content completion.
                I also set aside an extra week at the end to allow ample room
                for any additional tasks which tend to arise during the 
                latter phases of any game project.
                
                

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">

                The technical infrastructure involved presenting questions 
                that were randomly selected from a preset array of custom 
                data assets, then Unreal’s event callback system would 
                activate various effects based  on the accuracy of their 
                answer. After successfully answering five questions and 
                reaching the end, the player would then be added to the 
                leaderboard. The Leaderboard data was stored with Unreal’s 
                SaveGame feature and the FFileHelper library to generate 
                a .xml file accessible outside the game. The final product 
                was very successful, with high popularity at the conference 
                and gleaming feedback from my clients. I'm very proud of 
                the work I completed and my management of the project's 
                constraints.
