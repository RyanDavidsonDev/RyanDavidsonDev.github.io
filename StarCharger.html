              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                This game was conceived as a fast-paced, speed-centric space shooter. we 
                designed the player's stats and abilities around this central goal. The player
                collects energy from either a limited trickle of independtly generated pellets, 
                or by destroying asteroids. with this energy, the player is able to charge and
                fire shots. As they charge, they increase their hit box temporarily and their
                speed permanently. when the player has maxed out their energy and 
                speed values, they can right click to charge a boost. After which they are 
                permamently slightly faster and this gameplay loop restarts. The game also features
                a very polished Diegetic UI. All of the player stats are presented through the
                flavor of a ship's control console, with the gameplay being displayed on the 
                console's screen. The pause and options menus are presented as holographic popups,
                and the end game is flavored as an error screen.                
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We'd started as a team of 3 programmers and one producer, later 
                recruiting an artist, and three composers/audio engineers. I'd 
                originally joined the team simply as a programmer, but as time
                went on, our producer, Ryan Dunagan, became less available. I 
                stepped up to fill in those gaps, and eventually became a producer
                myself before he had to step away from the project entirely. While
                we still followed his previous guidance on the direction of our 
                game concept, and the workflows he taught us, I became the one to 
                oversee those workflows. Setting weekly sprints, planning/delegating 
                tasks, and monitoring any obstacles that might stall our progress. 
                I balanced these responsibilities while still keeping up with my role
                as a programmer. I enjoyed the project management, but I was still
                passionate about the technical details of the game. This was actually
                an incredibly beneficial pairing of roles. As my technical involvement 
                was essential towards understanding the progress we were making. In 
                addition to managing the organization of our git repository and 
                communicating with the other pgrammers given how complex our workflow
                and codebase was. This balance was also incredibly useful when 
                resolving technical issues. Which required not just technical knowledge, 
                but also a broad understanding of the full picture.

                The Diegetic UI was one of the most exciting aspects to emerge from our brainstorming.
                the console HUD and in-game presentation of the loss, pause, and options menus gave
                the game a unique flavor that everyone on the team was very proud of.

              <h3 class="project-details__row-content-title">Technical systems</h3>
              <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                While no one technical system stands out among my work on Star Charger, 
                each and every aspect of the project has deepened my understanding of both
                Unity and game development best practices. In particular I enjoyed and 
                learned the most from protoptyping the gameplay mechanics, and managing the 
                Git repository.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                The initial concept for our game had mostly do with the movement of the character,
                with only basic details planned for the energy mechanics and movement of the 
                asteroids. This left substantial space with the potential (but also necessity) to
                explore what exactly each of those mechanics would look like. I knew that fun 
                couldn't realistically be evaluated without seeing the ideas in action, so I 
                wanted to give us a basis to test them firsthand as quickly as possible. 
                However, I also wanted us to be able to revisit, explore, and iterate on our ideas.
                A common strategy I used was to frequently parameterize the gameplay values, this 
                allowed us to quickly change (or even temporarily remove) a mechanic without 
                having to rewrite or even recompile our code. 
                
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                With the player energy and speed
                mechanics specifically, I also utilized Unity's ScriptableObject system. By 
                building various templates and through simple inheritance structures, we were able 
                to not only quickly swap out various configurations, but even store them on hand 
                for future revisits. This allowed us to move on from an idea without abandoning  
                it altogether. I do somewhat regret that the systems in place ended up being
                rather complicated (from the perspective of both the players and developers). But 
                thanks to having set up that prototpying infrastructure, I can 
                guarantee that the final result was fun and satisfying. And now that I have experience with the process, I'll be better able to prioritize 
                the components of each system, and keep them more streamlined in the future.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                The entity generation systems that handle asteroids and energy were one of the first 
                ones we built, but we kept 
                iterating on them through much of development. By parameterizing the values, we 
                were able to assign different speeds, directions, and frequencies for every entity. 
                The asteroids were also given individual values for health, size, and energy amounts,
                all of which were correlated. We were also able to assign randomized ranges for the 
                values. By keeping these values accessible, we were able to identify the most important 
                values, minimizing or completely nullifying the ones that turned out to be less impactful 
                or even frustrating. 
                 All of the entities that were spawned were funneled through Unity's object pooling
                system to minimize the performance costs of destruction and reinstanciation of entities.

              <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                Even if I hadn't been the producer on this project, I'm sure I still would've been
                heavily involved and invested in the git management and organization. I've spent
                a significant amount of time researching git. How it works and how to use it 
                effectively and efficiently. Put simply, I find it incredibly interesting to 
                examine how such a powerful tool interfaces with the systems being built by the 
                developers. It has consequences on not only the technical functionality of your 
                project, but also the collaborative workflow. I learned to stay on top of both 
                of these aspects. Anticipating issues before they came up, and resolving the 
                ones that did, and facilitating the integration of everyone's work. Managing 
                all of this also resulted in me gaining a wide understanding of all 
                of our game systems, which was invaluable for debugging. Any time a teammate
                ran into an issue or had a question, I was able to tell them exactly where to 
                start looking for the related functionaltiy.
