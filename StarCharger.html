              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                This game was conceived as a fast-paced, speed-centric space shooter. we 
                designed the player's stats and abilities around this central concept. The player
                collects energy from either a limited trickle of independently generated pellets, 
                or by destroying asteroids. With this energy, the player is able to charge and
                fire shots. As they charge, they increase their hit box temporarily and their
                speed permanently. When the player has maxed out their energy and 
                speed values, they can right click to charge a boost. Temporarily increasing
                their speed greatly and granting them invulnerability. When the loop ends their speed 
                is permanently slightly increased, and the gameplay loop restarts. The game also features
                a very polished Diegetic UI. All of the player stats are presented through the
                flavor of a ship's control console, with the gameplay being displayed on the 
                console's screen. The pause and options menus are presented as holographic popups,
                and the end game is flavored as an error screen.                
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We'd started as a team of 3 programmers and one producer, later 
                recruiting an artist, and three composers/audio engineers. I'd 
                initially joined the team solely as a programmer. However, as time
                went on, our producer, Ryan Dunagan, became less available. I 
                stepped up to help him out with the day-to day project management,
                and eventually became a producer
                myself before he had to step away from the project entirely. While
                we still followed his previous guidance on the direction of our 
                game concept and the workflows he taught us, I became the one to 
                oversee those workflows. Setting weekly sprints, planning/delegating 
                tasks, and monitoring any obstacles that might stall our progress. 
                I balanced these responsibilities while still keeping up with my role
                as a programmer. I enjoyed the project management, but I was still
                passionate about the technical details of the game. This actually turned out
                to be highly beneficial. As my technical involvement 
                was essential towards understanding and therefore managing the progress we 
                were making. As well as managing the organization of our git repository and 
                communicating with the other programmers the complexity of our workflow 
                and tools. This balance was also incredibly useful when 
                resolving technical issues. Which required not just technical knowledge, 
                but also a broad understanding of the full picture.

                  The Diegetic UI was one of the most exciting aspects to emerge from our brainstorming.
                  the console HUD and in-game presentation of the loss, pause, and options menus gave
                  the game a unique flavor that everyone on the team was very proud of.

                  <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                    While no one technical system stands out among my work on Star Charger, 
                    each and every aspect of the project has deepened my understanding of both
                    Unity and game development best practices. In particular I enjoyed and 
                    learned the most from protoptyping the gameplay mechanics and managing the 
                    Git repository.
                  </p>
                  <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                    The initial concept for our game had mostly do with the movement of the character,
                    with only basic details planned for the energy mechanics and movement of the 
                    asteroids. This resulted in significant potential (but also necessity) to
                    explore what exactly each of those mechanics would look like. I know that predicting
                    how fun an idea is can be unreliable without seeing it firsthand. So I wanted to
                    establish a foundation  to see our ideas in action. However, I also wanted us to be 
                    able to easily revisit, explore, and iterate on our ideas.
                    A common strategy I used was to frequently parameterize values important to 
                    the gameplay, this allowed us to quickly change (or even temporarily remove) 
                    a mechanic without having to rewrite or even recompile our code.                 
                  </p>
                  <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                    The entity generation systems that handle asteroids and energy were one of the
                    first ones we built, but we kept iterating on them through much of development. 
                    By parameterizing the values, we were able to assign different speeds, 
                    directions, and frequencies for every entity. The asteroids were also given 
                    individual values for health, size, and energy amounts, all of which were 
                    correlated. We were also able to assign randomized ranges for the values. Trying
                    to sort through this complex system through code alone would have been untenable,
                    even with our technical expertise. But because
                    all of these variables were accessible through the editor, we were easily able 
                    to identify the most important values - minimizing or completely nullifying the 
                    ones that were unimpactful or frustrating. All of the entities that 
                    were spawned were also 
                    handled through Unity's object pooling system to minimize the performance 
                    costs of repeatedly destroying and reinstancing entities.
                  </p>
                  <p class="project-details__row-content-desc">
                    With the player energy and speed
                    mechanics specifically, I also utilized Unity's ScriptableObject system. By 
                    building various templates and through simple inheritance structures, we could 
                    not only quickly swap out various configurations, but even store them on hand 
                    for future revisits. This allowed us to move on from an idea without abandoning  
                    it altogether. On reflection, the systems that we ended up settling on were rather
                    complicated and hard for players to understand. But the protype infrastructure
                    that we put in place allows us to at least know the mechanics are satisfying once understood,
                    and will make it much easier if we decide to rework the system in the future.
                    Most importantly, now that I more thoroughly understand the process, I'll be better 
                    able to prioritize the most important aspects. Meaning the next project I work on
                    will be much more streamlined from both a player and developer perspective.

                    Source Control was also an essential tool for both our productivity, and one I became
                    very familiar with.
                    Even if I hadn't been the producer on this project, I'm sure I still would've been
                    heavily involved and invested in the management and organization of our git repository
                    because I do earnestly find it a fascinating tool to learn how to use effectively. 
                    It's just incredibly gratifying to learn how to integrating the disparate
                    systems each developer produces, and even explore different iterations of them.
                    I learned how to use it for both the projects technical functionality and collaborative
                    workflow. Anticipating issues before they came up, resolving the 
                    ones that did, and facilitating the integration of everyone's work. Managing 
                    all of this also provided me a wide understanding of all 
                    of our game systems, which was invaluable for debugging and design feedback. 
                    Any time a teammate ran into an issue or had a question, I was able to tell them 
                    exactly where to start looking for the related functionality.
