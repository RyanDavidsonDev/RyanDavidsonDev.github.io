              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The first conceit for the game was inspired by playing a randomization 
                mod for the popular metroidvania game Hollow Knight. I realized that much of 
                why I enjoyed the original game was the process of learning how and where 
                to use each new upgrade. Having to backtrack through my memories and level 
                design to figure out how to use my new ability to move forward was a very 
                compelling puzzle to solve, and the randomizer mod allowed me to 
                solve the puzzle in entirely new ways. I realized I wanted to make this loop a core pillar
                of my next game project. I drew further inspiration from roguelikes, 
                with their constant loop of resetting to discover new abilities. 
                A game in which the player progresses through a metroidvania-type progression between
                the replay loop of a roguelike, while also granting them the  agency to approach 
                the progression in whatever order they chose.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">

                After I'd been working on it independantly for some time, I later decided to revisit the project
                for a capstone class at my University.
                The Capstone class was split into two segments; the first I’d used to expand and
                fill out the gameplay mechanics: to add more depth to the randomization, improve
                the level design, and zero in on a few gaps in the design. I do wish I’d had more
                time to keep fleshing out the core design of the game - the randomization mechanics
                especially felt a lack of substance. However, by
                that point the second segment of the class had started, which was to focus on final
                polish and juice for the game. This involved surface level changes such as
                audio implementation and bug fixing. I also really enjoyed fine tuning various effects
                from the abilities - Particularly mechanical tidbits such as the recharge delays on stamina.

                The player's goal is to collect four upgrade: Sprint, Invisibility, 
                Double Jump, and the Cyber Eye (a vision upgrade). Collecting each ability made it easier for 
                them to progress throughout the level by improving platforming abilities, 
                adding different options to interact with the environment, or making it
                easier to evade enemies
