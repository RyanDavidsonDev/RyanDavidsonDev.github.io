              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                This game was originally created for the 2024 Global Game Jam, with the theme 
                "make me laugh". The mechanical premise of the game was a minigame centric battle 
                royale with the central win/loss mechanic being based around laughter. Collecting 
                some items (such as the whoopie Cushion or air horn) would allow you to force 
                other players to laugh, while others (doing taxes) would decrease your own,
                laugh value, represented by a meter on the UI. When players had higher laugh
                values they would move faster. This established a sense of risk-reward, as if 
                their meter reached the max value, they would lose control over laughter, thus being
                eliminated from the game. We added three separate Game Modes, each with unique 
                win conditions. King of the Hill allowed players to earn points by standing in 
                control zones that would periodically shift around the map. An obstacle course 
                awarded the first player to reach the end. And the Last Man Standing was a free
                for all in which the player still alive and with the lowest laugh meter at the 
                end of the round would win.

                I hadn't taken on as firm of a leadership role in this project as I had in others.
                This was due to wanting to focus on the technical aspects and refamiliarize 
                myself with Unreal Engine, which I hadn't used in some time, and would be using to work on
                 <a href="https://ryandavidsondev.github.io/BitwiseKey.html" 
                style="text-decoration:underline" 
                target="_blank">Bitwise Key</a>. The main contributions I provided were implementing
                the players item abilities, as well as the logic surrounding the three different game
                modes (as in the options for game modes visible to the players, as well as
                Unreal Engine's Game Mode and Game State infrastructure). This involved creating 
                the Base Game Mode, as well as two children to handle the added rulesets in King
                of the Hill and the Obstacle Course. Even in a less leadership-oriented role,
                my skills still came in handy for instructing my less experienced team members 
                on how to use Git, acting as intermediary between them and the most experienced 
                developers, and even resolving all of the major git issues that arose.
